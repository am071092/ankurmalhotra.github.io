Hi, I'm Ankur!. I'm a software developer based in Wellington, New Zealand. 
I've always had a passion for programming and consider myself very lucky to do what I do for a living. 
I created this blog simply to jot down stuff I've learnt from researching exciting topics online or from working on some random weekend project.
